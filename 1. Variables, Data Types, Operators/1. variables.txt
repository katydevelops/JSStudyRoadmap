VAR
Key characteristics of var:
    - Function-scoped or globally-scoped
    - Can be redeclared and reassigned
    - Hoisted to the top of its scope

LET
Key characteristics of let:
    - Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let provides block-scoping for variables
    - Block-scoped
    - Can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope
    - Not hoisted

CONST 
Key characteristics of const:
    - Also Introduced in ES6 in 2015
    - Block-scoped
    - Cannot be reassigned or redeclared
    - Must be initialized at declaration
    - Not hoisted

Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
    - The TDZ is a behavior of let and const where they cannot be accessed before declaration:
javascript

        console.log(x);  // Undefined (due to hoisting)
        var x = 5;

        console.log(y);  // ReferenceError (TDZ)
        let y = 10;

Const with Objects and Arrays
    - While const prevents reassignment, it doesn't make objects or arrays immutable:

Global Object Property
    - Variables declared with var in the global scope become properties of the global object (window in browsers):

Advanced: const and Object Freezing
    - For true immutability with const objects, use Object.freeze():
    - Note: Object.freeze() is shallow, nested objects can still be modified.
